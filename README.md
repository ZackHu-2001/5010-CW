### Welcome to Zack's implementation of 5010 Milestone!!

### How to use
Two manners are allowed, either command line variables or type in manually when the program starts running
  - For the first manner, **"java -jar example.jar pathToYourFile.txt"**
  - For the second manner, you would see the promp once start the game, like **"Please provide the path to the world file:
    "**, then you can type in the path to the file.

### Explanation to running example (with my own defined map)
- In the first run, I displayed how the target moves around the house.
- In the second run, I displayed how to output the image of map.
- In the third run, I displayed the room's information through input room index.
- In the last run, I displayed the room's neighbor information through input room index.
